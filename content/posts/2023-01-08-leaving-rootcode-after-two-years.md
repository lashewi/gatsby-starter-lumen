Last December was a very emotional day for me as I was bidding farewell to an organization that had presented me with tremendous opportunities and learning over the previous two years. It was an incredible experience and a remarkable journey with wonderful people.

I’d like to thank the leadership team and all of my leads for their guidance over the years in getting me to this point, especially for providing me with the opportunity to grow. Thank you to everyone on my team and colleagues for making my job easier.

I wish [Rootocode](https://rootcodelabs.com/) nothing but success. I look forward to keeping in contact and hope our paths will cross again. I wish you all good luck in your future endeavors.
