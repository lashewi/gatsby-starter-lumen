  surpassing 100 million users in record time, outpacing even ChatGPT’s growth.
  Although Meta isn’t explicitly aiming to replace Twitter, it sees an
  opportunity to challenge its dominance. The question remains whether Threads
  can capture the same cultural cachet and impact that Twitter once had.
  However, the significance of this entire Twitter and Threads saga lies in the
  fact that Meta released Threads as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) which is
  still in its infancy, seeking to understand its relevance in the ever-evolving
  internet landscape.

Enable early and continuous delivery of working software to users, aiming for frequent updates. Teams should regularly present complete and potentially shippable software. This approach fosters early and valuable feedback, ensuring a genuine measure of progress and allowing for timely releases as needed. It discourages unproductive activities that yield little forward movement. No matter how elaborate your UML models, well-written requirements, or fancy design documents may be, their value diminishes if your software fails to function effectively. Working software remains the ultimate measure of success in any development process. That’s not to say that documentation isn’t important, In many cases, proper documentation is needed. Avoid relying solely on completed tasks or milestones to demonstrate product delivery progress. Embrace a dynamic process focused on delivering functional software and incorporating user feedback.

[The Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/):

> Working software over comprehensive documentation

The importance of working software is also highlighted in [Agile Principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html):

> \#1 Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
>
> \#3 Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
>
> \#7 Working software is the primary measure of progress.

When it comes to software delivery, elaborate documentation alone is insufficient without working software. You can have the most elaborate UML models, the most well-written requirements, and the fanciest design documents, but if your software doesn’t work, none of those matters. While documentation may be essential for regulatory compliance and contracts, the focus should always be on the actual product, ensuring it remains in a working state to facilitate feedback and on-demand functionality delivery.

Returning to the Threads story, this isn’t the first time Threads has been introduced. In 2019, Meta unveiled a messaging app for Instagram users, also named Threads, with a focus on short video and photo messages akin to Snapchat. However, this version of Threads was eventually discontinued in 2021. Now, with the new iteration of Threads catering to text-based messages, its place in the internet world remains to be seen, and whether it will be a successful endeavor or another fail-fast battle.

By following Agile principles and maintaining a user-centric focus, Meta may find the key to long-term success and relevance in the ever-evolving landscape of social media. Only time will tell the fate of Threads, and we eagerly await its impact on the digital sphere.
