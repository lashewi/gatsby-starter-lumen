Two months ago, I wanted to complete the SAA-C02 exam and I set myself up with a goal. The following note is about how I tackled it.

I did some research and decided to buy the following content from Udemy,

* Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate 2022 by Stephane Maarek <https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/>

He basically sums up everything and also follows up with hands-on videos, highly recommend the course. This course might serve as a good reference in the future as it’s constantly updated and videos are re-recorded to catch up with the changes. Look into his presentation which will help you to quickly run through everything.

* AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Practice Exams by Jon Bonso <https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-amazon-practice-exams-saa-c03/>

This helped me to know where I am at, highly recommend this because there are so many good explanations and his exams are up to the standards of AWS and very similar to the real thing.

* Skim through the **AWS whitepapers**, highly recommend this one.

I have no experience with other courses but I heard Neal Davids’s course (<https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-hands-on/>) is good too. The exam only had a few trick questions but altogether questions are very similar to JB, pretty much scenario-based. I manage to get everything done within 5 weeks; I highly recommend planning things ahead and sticking to a timeline.

Few tips on the exam apart from the obvious ones

1. If you are a non-native English speaker, you can get an Extra 30 minutes on your AWS Exam — follow Request Exam Accommodations.
2. Short note — <https://github.com/keenanromain/AWS-SAA-C02-Study-Guide> (Not really up to date, but it works)
3. If you have already done an AWS exam, look into the offers you have.

I hope this helps someone. If you have any questions, happy to answer :)
